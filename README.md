## Quick Start

### Installation
    gem install ponder

### Usage

#### Setting up
```ruby
require 'ponder'

@thaum = Ponder::Thaum.new do |config|
  config.nick   = 'Ponder'
  config.server = 'chat.freenode.org'
  config.port   = 6667
end
```
#### Event handling
```ruby
# Join a channel when connected
@thaum.on :connect do
  @thaum.join '#ponder'
end

# Echo messages matching /foo/ back to the channel
@thaum.on :channel, /foo/ do |event_data|
  @thaum.message event_data[:channel], 'bar!'
end

# Print the joined user's nickname
@thaum.on :join do |data|
	user = data[:join].user
	puts "User joined #{user.nick}"
end

# Print the parted user's nickname
@thaum.on :part do |data|
	user = data[:part].user
	puts "User parted #{user.nick}"
end
```
#### Starting the Thaum
```ruby
@thaum.connect
```

## Discworld Context
So, why all that silly names? Ponder Stibbons? Thaum? Twoflogger (referring to Twoflower), BlindIo? What's the Mended Drum? Who's the Librarian? Simply put, I freaking enshrine Terry Pratchett's Discworld Novels and there were no better name for this project than Ponder. Ponder Stibbons is the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic at the Unseen University of Ankh Morpork. He researched the Thaum, like the atom, just for magic. I just love that character, so there we are. If you're a fan too or want to talk about the Discworld, the framework, whatever, don't hesitate to contact me.
